# The Data Behind the Helmet

This project presents a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard built using cleaned and merged data from the Ergast Developer Dataset, covering Formula 1 seasons from 1994 to 2024.

The goal was to build an immersive and data-driven experience that allows users to explore driver careers, team contributions, and seasonal performance trends across 30 years of F1 history.

🔧 Data Preparation & Cleaning:
The dataset was obtained from the Ergast Developer API and included multiple CSV files across entities such as races, qualifying, constructors, and results. We conducted a focused data-cleaning phase to optimize for analysis and performance:

Filtered essential attributes from each file (e.g., raceId, driverId, constructorId, qualifying times, race results, status, points).

Removed unused columns and normalized categorical fields.

Merged datasets into a single master file using Power Query, joining:

Race results with race metadata (location, year)

Driver information with constructor details

Qualifying performance with final results

Resulted in a clean, analysis-ready CSV for efficient Power BI integration.

📊 Dashboard Features:
🔹 Driver Career Overview:
Summary of debut year, nationality, wins, podiums, and total points.

Dynamic constructor-colored visuals.

Conditional cards showing First and Last Races, styled with team colors based on row-specific logic.

🔹 Points by Season (1994–2024):
Yearly performance chart, color-coded by constructor.

Interactive tooltips displaying constructor, points, and race context.

Automatically highlights peak performance years.

🔹 Constructor Contribution Breakdown:
Shows how many points each driver contributed to each team they drove for.

Highlights dominant stints vs minor team appearances.

🔹 Slicer Interactivity:
Year slicer dynamically updates visuals (e.g., constructor name/color defaulting to most recent in that year).

Constructor hover behavior enables exploratory insights per team.

Tooltip-rich environment enhances user experience.

⚙️ Technical Highlights:
Built entirely in Power BI with DAX measures for:

Dynamic constructor color logic

Hover-based first/last race context

Conditional background formatting

Used Power Query M language for transformations and joins.

Optimized performance with star schema logic and minimized table joins.

🎯 Outcome:
This dashboard offers a powerful platform to:

Explore the career of any driver from 1994–2024

Analyze their seasonal progression, team transitions, and peak performances

Compare team contributions across time in a highly visual and intuitive way
